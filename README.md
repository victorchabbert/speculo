WebApplication thought for SmartMirrors !

## Description

The goal of Speculo is to carry general intents to specialized web applications to be displayed on any device.
In short this is what Speculo is capable of:
 - format JSON, text (, facebook messages) and QR codes and into intents mean to `carry the will of the user`
 - `roots the messages` to the proper device and application
 - manage the `authentication` of users, outputDevices and applications
 - offer a `flexible permissions` system
 - use iframe and extensions to encapsulate client side apps and `act as an os` managing user's apps
 - provide tools to `port in no time existing web apps`
